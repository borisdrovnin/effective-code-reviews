A *code review* is a process of consciously and systematically examining source code for mistakes, and to improve
the overall quality and maintainability of the code. Code reviews 
(in contrast to [*code inspections*](http://www.methodsandtools.com/archive/archive.php?id=66)) 
have been 
repeatedly shown to accelerate and streamline the process of software development like few other practices can. 

There are peer code review tools and software, but the concept itself is important to understand. Software is written by
human beings. Software is therefore often riddled with mistakes. To err is, of course, human, so this
is an obvious correlation. But what isnâ€™t so obvious is why software developers often rely on manual or 
automated testing to vet their code to the neglect of that other great gift of human nature: the ability 
to see and correct mistakes ourselves. 

This lesson aims to provide an introduction to code reviews, what to look for and how to conduct them.
